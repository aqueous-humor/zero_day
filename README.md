# Vagrant #

This is a project that gives you hands-on experience using virtual machines in place of the specially dedicated sandbox
es provided by ALX on the intranet. This helps you isolate and maintain a stable environment that will run the same on machine.

The tools that will be utilized for this project are:

   * VirtualBox - A virtualization software that helps users spawn virtual machines on their computer.
   * Vagrant - A tool that sits on top of  the VM (Virtual Machine) provider, ie VirtualBox for this project. It helps      us build and manage virtual machine environments in a single workflow.
